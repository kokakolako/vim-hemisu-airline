## Hemisu Theme for Airline

I created a theme for airline, which should look like my slightly modified
version of the [hemisu vim-colorscheme](https://github.com/noahfrederick/vim-hemisu), created by Noah Frederick.

### How to install:

Clone repository

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/kokakolako/vim-airline-hemisu.git
```

Add `let g:airline_theme = 'hemisu_airline'` to your vimrc.
